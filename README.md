# API8
API8 participation 2024 64Ko and 64Mo 



Based from GL4Dummies and his functionalities to make great looking demos.

Ideas at start : 

- Make a shattering glass
- Moving in sync with music
- particles
- smooth transitions
- Maybe a camera follow of a ball shattering glasses and dominos
- Dominos falls 


Ideas realized : 

- Have particles moving
- Use of fractals
- Use of noise with transitions smooth
- A good followup
